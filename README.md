# SQLProject
## Overview

The material in this repository shows off my SQL work with fake data for a fake company, Rockbuster Stealth LLC. The business intelligence (BI)Â department asked for my help with their launch strategy for a new online video service.

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board asked the following questions to help drive their 2020 company strategy:

* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
